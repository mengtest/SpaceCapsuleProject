Small android game made on Unity

This is a small personnal project that I'm making in parallel to my game design studies. I'm porting to android a one button game I made
for school last year using Unity, in order to get some practice coding in C#.

This is gonna be poorly coded, but hey I'm a game designer, not a developper :D

Edit : I'm trying to use as much C# features as possible in order to learn the language better. Some (read: almost all) of the code I will write won't be optimal, but I'm learning a lot by using things I would have never used otherwise for a game that simple (Structs, output arguments, nice clean OOP, all that good stuff). 
So this is still going to be poorly coded of course, but for different reasons ^^
