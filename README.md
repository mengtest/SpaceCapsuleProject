Small android game made on Unity

This is a small personnal project that I'm making in parallel to my game design studies. I'm porting to android a one button game I made
for school last year using unity, in order to get some practice coding in C#.

This is gonna be poorly coded, but hey I'm a game designer, not a developper :)
